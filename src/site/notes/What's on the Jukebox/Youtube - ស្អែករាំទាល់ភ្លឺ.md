I'm now obsessed with this beautiful album (Sinn Sisamouth and others).
I'm drawing a blank as to it's context and origins. It has a lot more traditional Khmer music going on the background of it and it's very dreamy and psychedelic but with a very melancholy almost folk feel apart from this one here which is just pure joy. It translates roughly to "Dance until tomorrow". Sisamouth I think had some Laos music training and to my untrained ears there are some real similarities to Molam Thai music which I also love to bits but with a lot more harmonic invention. 

From that picture I can see Sinn Sisamouth, Pen Ran and Ros Sereysothea who are all on this record.

For now I'm just enjoying the mystery of it all.

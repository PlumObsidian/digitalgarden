I've been asleep to so many musical possibilities. I'm tired of certain ways of thinking about music. I realise not many may explore what I'm finding in this branch but I know where this came from in my youth: My parents broke me in to see 2001 a Space Odyssey when I was a very small kid - The Ligetti Chorales as we went through the star gate had a lasting impact. Star Wars and John Williams was never going to cut it for me after that..

[[New Listening/‘Zeit’ How Tangerine Dream Brought Ambient Music To The World\|‘Zeit’ How Tangerine Dream Brought Ambient Music To The World]] Zeit sent me back out there..

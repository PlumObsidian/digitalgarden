## Breeding and Mating

 Foxes in the UK typically mate in January and February, with the vixen (female) in heat for only 20 days.
 During this time, dog foxes (males) will roam widely to locate females, often straying outside their usual home ranges.
 When a male finds a receptive female, he will stay close by, and the pair may engage in vocalizations, such as the "hup-hup-hup" triple-barks of dog foxes.
 Mating takes place several times, and the male may lift his tail high in excitement and nuzzle or groom the female.

## Pregnancy and Litter Size

 After mating, the vixen becomes pregnant, and the average litter size is four or five, although eight cubs are not uncommon.
 Newborn cubs are blind, deaf, dark-grey in color, and weigh around 120g.
 After 14 days, their eyes open, and they start to develop their senses and physical characteristics.

## Weaning and Dispersal

 Cubs are suckled for the first four weeks, then progressively weaned until seven weeks old.
 From late September, the family group breaks up, and some or all of the cubs disperse.
 Dominant cubs tend to grow faster and receive more social grooming from adults, leading to a stronger integration into the social group.

## Social Structure and Dominance

 Foxes live in social groups, typically consisting of equal numbers of dogs and vixens.
 Within these groups, a strict dominance hierarchy is established, with dominant individuals having preferential access to food and resources.
 Dominant cubs may fight with siblings, and the loser may be chased and bitten on the rump or tail.
 As cubs get older, they may fight by standing on their hind legs and placing their forelegs on their opponent's chest, trying to push each other over.

## Urban Fox Behaviour

 Urban foxes have adapted to living with humans and can be seen in gardens and urban areas.
 They have a varied diet, including earthworms, insects, fruit, and vegetables, as well as domestic and wild birds and mammals.
 Urban foxes may become over-confident and less wary of people if fed heavily and regularly, so it's essential to only provide food in moderation and not encourage them to approach strangers.

## Observations and Insights

 Foxes are most active at night, with vertically oriented pupils allowing them to see in dim light.
 They have sensitive whiskers and spines on their tongue, similar to those found in cats.
 Foxes will often fight by displaying ritualized behaviors, such as foxtrotting, to establish dominance without violent combat.

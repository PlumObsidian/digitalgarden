## UK Fox Birth Times

Foxes in the UK typically give birth to their cubs between late January and well into April, with the peak time for births occurring around mid-March.348 The gestation period for foxes lasts between 49 and 58 days, usually around 52 days.34 Cubs are born deaf, blind, and unable to regulate their body temperature, so the vixen (female fox) stays with them in the den for the first two weeks.48

Foxes mate from December to February, and the cubs are usually born in March or April.1 The earliest confirmed records of fox cubs in the UK include one born in early December and another in late January.4 The latest verified UK birth was in late October, suggesting successful mating around September.4 However, these are rare cases and the typical breeding cycle for foxes in the UK is from late January to early February.48

Foxes breed only once a year, and most mating occurs in January or early February.4 The vixen looks for a suitable den or 'earth' to give birth, which could be under tree roots, in a rock crevice, under a garden shed, or even in a pile of rubbish.

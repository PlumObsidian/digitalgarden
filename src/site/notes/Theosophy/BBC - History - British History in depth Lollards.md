# [BBC - History - British History in depth: Lollards](https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/lollards_01.shtml)

## Critics of the Church

John Wyclif and his Lollard followers were the first recognised critics of the established church since the fifth century. Wyclif was born in Yorkshire in the 1330s - he was a theologian at Balliol College, Oxford, and a 'realist' who believed that one's knowledge is derived from within rather than through the senses. He rejected the Roman church, preferring a church comprising the body of the elect with all authority derived from the scriptures - 'lordship depended on grace' - and he denied transubstantiation and believed in the spiritual Eucharist rather than the physical one. Because of his beliefs, Wyclif wanted the church reformed and its wealth removed.

The Lollards who followed Wyclif derived their name from the medieval Dutch words meaning 'to mutter' (probably reflecting their style of worship, which was based on reading the scriptures). They represented a general but very limited, minority reform movement. The institution of the Church, its landed wealth and tax exemptions offended several key groups who bore understandable resentment towards the bureaucratic and arrogant institution. The extent of actual theological alienation is far less clear.

The most important Lollards were a group of knights who were part of the king's court. These included Sir William Neville, Sir John Montague and Sir William Beachamp, with sympathetic support and active protection from the Black Prince and John of Gaunt (at least from 1371 to 1382), which reflected traditional noble anti-clericalism.

Richard II personally possessed a strong faith, and did not question the role of the established Church, yet he did little to stamp out the Lollards, tolerating key adherents to their beliefs in his own court. The king was so self-absorbed, he failed to see that there were far more currents and movements in society as a whole. Richard, of course, had no problem in identifying rebellion with heresy and as an attack on God.

## Persecution

John Wyclif's theology went far beyond that eventually adopted by the Anglican Church of Elizabeth I. His aim was for a reformation of the Church, but his movement failed because of several factors - mainly the lack of an established printing press as a tool of dissemination, and the limited literacy of the population in the 14th century.

However, while Wyclif is a very important figure, the extent of his influence was limited and the sequence of events that allowed the Reformation to occur in the 16th century were completely non-existent during Richard's reign. Furthermore, if the Lollards had become a greater threat, they would have faced the full assault of the united Crown, Church and law. It would have made being a Lollard a very difficult proposition. Richard's personal piety makes any chance of further tolerance on his part highly unlikely.

Indeed, by the mid 1380s Richard started an active campaign against heresy in the kingdom, attacking heretical works, arresting Lollards and supporting the Church authorities. However, no new statutes were passed. His personal faith blossomed in the 1390s, a development suggested by three surviving artefacts - the Wilton Diptych (a small, portable altar piece, artist unknown, commissioned by Richard, and on view in the National Gallery), Westminster Abbey, and York Minster.

By Henry V's reign, the Crown and Church had united against the Lollards, had driven their followers underground, and in 1414 had defeated the one public outbreak of rebellion organised by the followers of this cause.

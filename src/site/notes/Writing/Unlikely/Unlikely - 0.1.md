The Coelocanth was not himself lately.

The irony of his situation was not lost on him; closer to the sea than he had been for years but looking down on it from above. Six hundred years on this earth. Six hundred years and what was this feeling? Nostalgia? Vertigo?

Was vertigo even a concept that a fish, however old, was supposed to feel? He had spent so long with the humans now that maybe this was what troubled him. How to reconnect with his inner fish. But again, how to connect with any concept of being a fish when you are six hundred years old, telepathic and not supposed to exist any more.

Vertigo. Yes. A perfectly rational fear of heights. By definition; a sea fish anywhere above sea level is going to learn pretty quickly about this concept.

## Soothing selections for January… with Zakia

Zakia selects songs to help us get through the last few days of January, with words from drummer and singer, Momoko Gill.

DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Zakia shares soothing selections to help get us through these last few days of January. There’s warming sounds from Madagascar, Uyghur folk music from Central Asia, new releases from Ego Ella May, Duval Timothy and CJ Mirra.

And Zakia’s guest, drummer, producer and singer Momoko Gill, pops by to tell us about her dreams, and to select a track that transports her to another place.

## The darker side of Dream Time… with Zakia

They say the veil is thinnest at this time of year… Zakia conjures the spirits with some spooky selections for a Samhain Dream Time, with the help of folk artist Angeline Morrison.

DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

As the evenings get darker and the night closes in, we prepare for Samhain with a Dream Time that dabbles a little more in shadow. Samhain is a pagan festival with Celtic roots that marks the start of winter, known to most as Halloween. It’s a time when the veil is thin between us and other realms, and so Zakia conjures the spirits with some spooky selections of eerie folk, spectral sounds and spiritual dub.

Plus the folk musician Angeline Morrison is on hand to act as our friendly Samhain guide. Angeline shares some reflections on the darkness of folk music, as well as the Halloween celebrations in her village in Cornwall, and shares a few songs for the season.

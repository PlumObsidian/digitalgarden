DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Journey into the world of Dream Time once more with your guide Zakia and her selections of healing meditative sounds, with cosmic jazz, celestial folk, and ritual trance music from Morocco. As we approach Halloween, Zakia shares a slightly spooky story from her own subconscious, and recommends a track to a listener who wants help drifting off to the land of slumber.

Also, we have a very special guest at the helm of the Dreambience mix - the artist, DJ and producer Beatrice Dillon. The Dreambience is where we take 30 minutes to let the music speak for itself - no interruptions - and for her takeover, Beatrice leads us through a selection of music that soundtracks a dream with parallel storylines and overlapping fragments, with vibraphones, strings, synths and more…

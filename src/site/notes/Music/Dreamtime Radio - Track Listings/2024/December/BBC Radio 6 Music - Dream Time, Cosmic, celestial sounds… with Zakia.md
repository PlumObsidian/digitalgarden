DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Journey into the world of Dream Time once more with your guide Zakia and her selections of healing, cosmic sounds. There’s space exotica from the late 1950s courtesy of composer Russ Garcia, dreamy jazz from London-based composer, bassist and vocalist Ruth Goller, and new music from sonic alchemist, multi-instrumentalist, and mystical folklore devotee Ozbolt, recorded on a retired church organ deep in the Croatian Mountains.

Plus the Californian outsider icon and cosmic synth busker The Space Lady drops into Dream Time. Born in Colorado, she became famous in the Bay Area of California in the late 70s and 80s for her regular playing covers of pop classics on a vintage accordion and a Casio keyboard, and wearing a distinctive winged helmet. She shares a dream she had involving a vision of a healthy world for future generations.

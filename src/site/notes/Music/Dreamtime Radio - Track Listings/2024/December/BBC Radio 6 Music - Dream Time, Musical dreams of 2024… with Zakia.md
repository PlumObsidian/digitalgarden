DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

It’s the final journey into Dream Time of 2024, and to mark the occasion Zakia shares two hours of soothing sounds that have helped us get us through this year. There’s lots of lovely music as picked by the listeners - some old and some new - as well as some of Zakia’s own favourites. Expect 70s psych-rock from Japan, mystical medieval vocals and sounds from a fairy garden… As well as a special Dreambience mix exclusively made up of listener selections.

Plus the French-Senegalese artist anaiis is our final guest of the year. She shares some thoughts on her latest record, the music she turns to in times of strife, and the importance of dreaming of a better world.

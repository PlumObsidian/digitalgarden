DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Dream Time heads down the rabbit hole for another musical journey through the imagination. This week, Zakia’s selections are inspired by the evocative power of both memory and dreams, with nostalgic folk, wistful ambient sounds and time-travelling dub.

We’ll be hearing reflections and selections from the legendary dubmaster Dennis Bovell. A pioneer in Dub and Lovers Rock, Dennis founded the British reggae group Matumbi and is a long time collaborator with dub poet Linton Kwesi Johnson. For Dream Time, he looks back on his own musical creations, and recalls a track inspired by a dream... And for the last 30 minutes we’ll slip into the Dreambience - an ambient vortex to help you tune out and wind down for the night…

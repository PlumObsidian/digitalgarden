DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…  
This week’s journey through the clouds features an Ethiopian classic reimagined by London-based band ZENA, Brazilian-inspired guitar meditations from Argentinian maestro Agustin Pereyra Lucena, and nostalgic folk from New England collective Old Saw, as well as new releases from Montreal’s Laurie Torres and Naarm outfit Acopia.  
Plus, we hear from Swedish singer, songwriter and co-founder of Grammy-nominated band Little Dragon, Yukimi. She shares music from her new EP ‘Yume’ - meaning ‘Dream’ in Japanese - and talks about embracing change, stepping into new chapters and the strange, beautiful melancholy of teenage years.

DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

'Tis the season… Zakia leans into the spookier side of things, taking inspiration from Samhain - the Celtic festival that marks the transition from the light to the dark. There’s haunting blues, spectral dub, eerie folk and tales of ghosts, beasts, witches, black cats, black swans and more. Zakia picks out some Lead Belly, Shirley Collins, Broadcast and Popol Vuh, as well as new releases from Faten Kanaan, Sirom, Om Unit and Lankum.

Plus, we hear from Welsh composer, pianist and triple harpist Cerys Hafana. They share the story behind their new album and its sleepy origins in folklore, as well as some reflections on dreams, harps and stories.

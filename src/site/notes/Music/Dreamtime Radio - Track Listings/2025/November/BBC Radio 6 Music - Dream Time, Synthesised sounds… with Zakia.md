DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

We enter the dreamy world of synthesisers tonight as Zakia celebrates the centenary of the birth of electronic pioneer Daphne Oram. Born 31st December 1925, Oram was the first full-time electronic music composer in Britain, cofounder of the BBC’s Radiophonic Workshop, and the inventor of her own synthesiser - the Oramics machine. Zakia sprinkles through some of Oram’s own works, as well as selections from artists that have followed in her footsteps. There’s music by Grace Jones, Mamman Sani, Loraine James and The Space Lady, as well as brand new music from Duval Timothy, Rosa Brunello and Marta Salogni.

Plus the French sound artist, poet and composer Félicia Atkinson shares a special Dreambience mix dedicated to both Daphne Oram and her cat, with music that echoes her sound as well as Félicia's own field recordings and words from Oram's 1972 book ‘An Individual Note of Music, Sound and Electronics’.

DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Join Zakia for the maiden Dream Time voyage of 2025 - whizzing our way through plenty of fresh-faced, whimsical and hopeful selections for the young year. There’ll be some fuzzy children’s folk, a tea ceremony from Ukraine, and playground chants from Haiti, as well as some new releases from the likes of My Jazzy Child and Rattle.

Plus a very special Dreambience mix conjured up by the weird and wonderful Stroud duo Mermaid Chunky, aka Freya Tate and Moina Moin. For Dream Time, they’ve crafted an audio adventure through what they describe as “a landscape of feverish hibernation and deep winter nostalgia” - featuring dreams and music from their family and friends, surreal poetry, 70s children’s TV soundtracks and plenty of homemade instruments.

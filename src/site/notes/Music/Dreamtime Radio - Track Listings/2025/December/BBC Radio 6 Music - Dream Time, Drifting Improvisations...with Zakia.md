## Drifting Improvisations...with Zakia

Drift through improvised dreamscapes and dub-hazed selections with your guide, Zakia Sewell. Plus, London musician Max Winter takes us down the Portal.


DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Zakia guides you through a constellation of improvised soundscapes and drifting guitar meditations. There’s music inspired by the majesty of Mount Fuji from Yussef Dayes, live, free-flowing improvisations from Los Angeles band Chewing, and a forthcoming release from South African drummer Asher Gamedze. Expect intuitive journeys, luminous textures, deep dub currents and music that seems to materialise as you hear it.

We’ll also be taken down the portal by London-based Max Winter, who shares how he weaves dreams and collage into his unique brand of experimental music.

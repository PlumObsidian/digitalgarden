DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions...

It's Slow Sunday on 6 Music, on the date when British summer time ends, and we embrace the seasonal shift towards winter, with shows across the day dialling down the tempo and encouraging listeners to relax and unwind, to reflect Mental Health Awareness Week. To mark it, Dream Time will be slowing things down even more than usual, leaning into hypnotic, heavenly, spiritual selections to give your brain a nice gentle bath…

Plus, Zakia is joined by a very special guest, the mystic, musician, and embodiment of laughing bliss... pioneer of ambient and spiritual music, Laraaji. He joins us for Slow Sunday, to channel a guided offering to bring some deep sonic healing for listeners.

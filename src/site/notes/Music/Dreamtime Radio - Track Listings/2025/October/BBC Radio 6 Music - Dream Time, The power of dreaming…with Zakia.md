DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams, playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Zakia pays tribute to Danny Thompson, the legendary bassist, jazz lover, and one of the founding members of one of her all-time favourite bands, Pentangle.

She celebrates National Poetry Day and 6 Music’s Way with Words with the help of her special guest, the poet, storyteller and activist aja monet. She selects a track for The Portal and reflects on the power of dreaming. Across the show, Zakia selects tracks from some of her favourite wordsmiths, including a poetic piece from a legend of the West Coast Black Arts movement and a tearjerker from the songwriter Judee Sill.

Plus, Zakia selects songs to inspire peace and soothe the soul, including some Finnish spiritual jazz, and a track made among the grapevines of a vineyard in South Australia...

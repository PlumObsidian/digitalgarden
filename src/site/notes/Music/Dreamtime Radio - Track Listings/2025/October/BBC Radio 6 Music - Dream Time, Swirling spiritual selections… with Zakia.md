DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Zakia brings the healing vibrations and spiritual sounds for your Sunday night, with jazz chants, haunting Welsh harp and Brazilian bossa nova. There’s new music from Sessa, Max Winter, Beverly Glenn-Copeland, Tony Njoku and Cerys Hafana, as well as some old favourites - including a reissue of folk spirituals from Sister Irene O’Connor.

Plus we’re transported to the Dreambience realms of the LA jazz collective Phi-Psonics. Their music is meditative, immersive and improvised - a collective dream that they invite their listeners to enter. Their Dreambience mix, presented by bandleader and bassist Seth Ford-Young, is filled with healing sounds and lots of space, giving our minds the time we need to make sense of the world around us.

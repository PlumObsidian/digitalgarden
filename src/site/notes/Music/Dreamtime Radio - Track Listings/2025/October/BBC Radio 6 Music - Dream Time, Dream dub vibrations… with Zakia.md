DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Zakia is joined in the studio by special guest Gavsborg for a bit of a chat and to share some musical recommendations. Sometimes known as Unkle G, Gavsborg is the founder of Equiknoxx Music - a label and collective creating ‘outernational Jamaican music’. Gavsborg brings with him a selection of tracks - some of his own, including an exclusive collaboration with Kenyan vocalist Rafiiki - and some discovered on his travels.

Elsewhere Zakia serves up some dubby, jazzy, dreamy selections - new music from the likes of Coby Sey, Lunch Money Life and Courtney Bailey, alongside some old favourites including Freddie McGregor, D\*Note and the Michael Garrick Septet.

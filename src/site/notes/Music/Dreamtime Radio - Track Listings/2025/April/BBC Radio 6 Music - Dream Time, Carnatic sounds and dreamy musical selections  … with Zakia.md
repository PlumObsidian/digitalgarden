## Carnatic sounds and dreamy musical selections … with Zakia

Sun 20 Apr 2025

Zakia wraps up the bank holiday weekend with some meditative sounds to send you off into a world of dreams…

DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Tumble down the rabbit hole with Zakia for another cosmic journey into Dream Time, and her selections of meditative, dreamy sounds. There’s an Indian film score from Tamil composer and violin player, T.K. Ramamoorthy; a dreamy gem found in a dusty record shop in a back street of Bangkok, plus an old favourite record found amongst Zakia’s house move, alongside new music from Barney Keen, Paul Jones, and Garoa.

And, elsewhere, we hear from special guest Sarathy Korwar, a percussionist who fuses traditional Indian music with contemporary improvisation. Born in the US, Sarathy spent his early years in Chennai, India, and is now a key fixture on the London jazz scene. Sarathy whisks us down the portal, taking us away with him to the backseat of his beat-up old car, and his memories driving around the streets of Pune, India, in the summer of 2007, with his cassette deck blaring out one track in particular…

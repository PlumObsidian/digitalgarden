# [BBC Radio 6 Music - Dream Time, Solstice selections…with Zakia](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002dpz2)

23/06/2025
## Solstice selections…with Zakia

Zakia embraces the light on the solstice weekend with selections conjuring memories of summer days…

DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Zakia embraces the light and conjures some pagan vibes, with music summoning memories of summer days. We hear sounds from a concert recorded in LA on the solstice night, a sunshine raga from one of Zakia’s favourite artists, and a call to loosen up and feel the setting sun courtesy of a German psychedelic jazz outfit.

Basking in the warmth of the longest day of the year, we’re guided through solstice with the help of Dream Time guest - folk singer, collector, writer and environmentalist, Sam Lee - an artist deeply connected to the folk tradition, and Britain’s seasonal customs. Joining the show from the shade in a peaceful woodland, Sam tells us about the celestial connections of the solstice and what this moment in the year means to him. He shares memories of a solstice pilgrimage in the Cairngorms, conjures moments spent in good company at neolithic sites…and sings us his most-loved song for that 3 am singing in the round moment, in the glow of a campfire…

Elsewhere, a moment to revel in the forthcoming festival season, via a live Bowie number, and a dreamy dedication to French New Age pioneer, Ariel Kalma.

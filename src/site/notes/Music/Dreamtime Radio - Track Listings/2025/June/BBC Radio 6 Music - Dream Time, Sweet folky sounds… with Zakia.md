# [BBC Radio 6 Music - Dream Time, Sweet folky sounds… with Zakia](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m002dcgm)

16-6-2025
## Sweet folky sounds… with Zakia

Zakia shares sweet nostalgic selections, with a nod to Father’s Day and some big musical birthdays. Plus a soft and foggy Dreambience mix from Yorkshire composer Kirk Barley.

DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Zakia shares sweet nostalgic selections, with a heavy sprinkling of folky sounds, fingerpicked guitars and dreamy percussion. There’s new music from Cameron Knowler, Qwalia and Elisabeth Klinck, and a load of old gems including Talk Talk, Bobbie Gentry and Utopia. We mark some big musical birthdays from two Dream Time favourites - Arthur Verocai and Peggy Seeger - and of course there’s something for all the paternal figures celebrating Father’s Day, including a track that features Zakia’s dad..!

Plus, we are transported to the soft, foggy landscapes of a Dreambience mix from Yorkshire composer and sound artist Kirk Barley. His mix sweeps across time, quietly inviting us into the gentle warmth of his dreams.

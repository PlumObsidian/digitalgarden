DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Time flies! This week marks one whole year of dreaming on the 6 Music airwaves. To celebrate, Zakia brings the party spirit with a show absolutely full to the brim with incredible selections sent in by the Dream Time listeners. There’s Brazilian jazz, sweet soul, leftfield folk and more, from artists like Milton Nascimento, Sons of Kemet and Thick Pigeon.

And it wouldn’t be a party without some extra special guests - fellow 6 Music selectors Jamz Supernova, Stuart Maconie and Mary Anne Hobbs all drop in to share dreamy tracks of their own. Plus, we’re revisited by Dream Time’s first-ever guest, the artist Jeremy Deller, who brings a very special recording from one of his recent exhibitions.

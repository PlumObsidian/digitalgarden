DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Join Zakia for another voyage through sounds to lift your spirits. This week’s guest is the South African cellist, composer and vocalist Abel Selaocoe, who shares music from his new album Hymns of Bantu and reflects on dreams in South African culture as a means of communicating with the ancestors. He also introduces what he believes to be the dreamiest instrument - the begenna, a 10-stringed lyre from Ethiopia, sometimes called King David’s Harp.

Elsewhere Zakia shares more sweet sounds from South Africa and beyond. There are sacred chants from Senegalese monks, French avant-garde sounds from the 1970s and some keyboard fantasies from Beverly Glenn-Copeland. Plus a whole stack of new releases, including from Melbourne’s Intermood, Glasgow’s Rebecca Vasment, Philadelphia’s Onilu and the Stockholm duo of Johan Jutterström and Alex Zethson.

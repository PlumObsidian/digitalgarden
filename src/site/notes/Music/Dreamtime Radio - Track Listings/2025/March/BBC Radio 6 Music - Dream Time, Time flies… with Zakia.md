DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Flit through far-flung fantasy worlds with Zakia on another two-hour musical voyage into the Dream Time. There’s Welsh selections to mark St. David’s Day by Heather Jones, Don Leisure and Gwilym Bowen Rhys, as well as some watery sounds for Pisces season, including a Zodiac concept album from the composer and occultist Mort Garson.

Plus there’s the usual smorgasbord of new releases from the likes of Anoushka Shankar, Jairus Sharif, Raisa K and this episode’s special guest - the saxophonist, composer, vocalist and Pisces Alabaster DePlume. Alabaster reads from his dream diary - which he started just for the show - taking us on distant journeys with magical cups of tea.

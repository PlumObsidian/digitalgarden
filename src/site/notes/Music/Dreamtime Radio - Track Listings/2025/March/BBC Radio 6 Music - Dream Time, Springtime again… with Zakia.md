DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

It’s Springtime again… Zakia salutes the Spring equinox with stories of stones, Sun Ra and songs about sakura, aka cherry blossoms. There’s some classics from Mary Lou Williams, Bobbie Gentry and Odetta, and lots of brand new releases, including Florence Adooni, Nyron Higor, Maria Somerville and WOOM.

Plus, we hear from the Japanese visual artist and musician Yoshino Shigihara - whose musical alias is Yama Warashi, which means mountain spirit. She takes us to her dreams of stones, spirits and flying high above Bristol and shares the Midori Takada song that soundtracks them.

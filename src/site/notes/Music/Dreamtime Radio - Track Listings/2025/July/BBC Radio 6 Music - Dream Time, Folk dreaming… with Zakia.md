DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

This weekend Zakia celebrates the birthday of one of her favourite artists - the English folk pioneer, song collector and singer Shirley Collins, who turned 90 yesterday on July 5th. To mark the special occasion, we asked Shirley to share some of her dreams, as well as select some traditional tunes that involve dreaming…

Elsewhere expect a selection of heavenly sounds from around the world, including Rwandan folk duo The Good Ones, Palestinian oud player Samih Madhoun and Colombian experimenter Zarigüeya, as well as some heartwarming favourites from Ivor Cutler and Daevid Allen.

We want to hear your dreams! Send in tales of your sleepy adventures to dreamtime@bbc.co.uk or text us on 03700 100 600

DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Zakia serves up two hours of soul-nourishing selections for your Sunday night, drawing from her collection of dreamy, dubbed-out sounds. Plus, Zakia brings a healthy load of her favourite new releases along, to honour 6 Music’s New Music Fix Friday. Also, we hear from a listener who recommends a track for the Dream Time sound world, which they used to listen to while doing a lot of dreaming while cruising around the Pacific Islands, and working on a ship during the mid-1970s.

Elsewhere in the show, we’re joined by Chicago-based multi-instrumentalist and collaborator Macie Stewart, who shares with us her most treasured album for keeping her company on long journeys, adding to the Dream Time Flight Mode collection. And, she tells us one of her most vivid dreams…

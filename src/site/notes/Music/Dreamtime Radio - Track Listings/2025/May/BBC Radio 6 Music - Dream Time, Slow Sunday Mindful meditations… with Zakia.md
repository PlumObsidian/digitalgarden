## Slow Sunday: Mindful meditations… with Zakia

Slow Sunday: Sink into healing sounds with Zakia, from mindful meditations to New Age dimensions. Plus, the musician Hinako Omori takes us on a peaceful riverside walk in Japan.


DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

It’s Slow Sunday on 6 Music - with shows across the day dialling down the tempo to reflect Mental Health Awareness Week. To mark it, Dream Time will be slowing things down even more than usual, leaning into hypnotic, heavenly, spiritual selections to give your brain a nice gentle bath… There’ll be New Age sounds from the likes of Iasos and Tony Scott, go-to heartwarmers from Massive Attack and Linda Lewis, and brand new soothing sounds from Duval Timothy and Rebecca Vasmant.

Plus, musician and sound artist Hinako Omori shares reflections on healing frequencies, forest bathing, and sonic chakras and takes us on a special meditative river walk through Japan—from a waterfall all the way down to the sea…

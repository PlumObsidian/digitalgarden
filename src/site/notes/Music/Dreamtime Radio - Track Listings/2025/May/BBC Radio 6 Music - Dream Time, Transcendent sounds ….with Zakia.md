DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Journey into dream worlds with Zakia, with her selections of woozy Italian jazz, smoky dubbed out psychedelia, and transcendent, flowing guitar rhythms from Argentina. Plus, Zakia brings a record from an Australian folk revival artist, found on a vinyl dig in south east London. Elsewhere, Zakia salutes Sun Ra for what would have been his 111th birthday, via cosmic spoken word poetry, courtesy of Sun Ra Arkestra members.

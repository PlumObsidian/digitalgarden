DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

Voyage with Zakia through an otherworldly, meditative soundtrack for your Sunday night, full of heavenly vocals, psychedelic grooves and deep meditative sounds. Expect some experiments in new age music from 1980s California, euphoric cumbia from Peruvian Amazonia, and a dubby Balearic take on a classic from Wham.

Plus, heavenly vocals from the likes of Chaka Khan, Sally Oldfield and Minnie Riperton, inspired by this week’s special guest - singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Laura Groves, a prolific artist and a passionate self-recordist and self-producer of her own work. Laura tells listeners about a track which transports her to memories of the wild Irish countryside, as well as to one night at a venue in Dalston. And she tells us about one of her most vivid dreams…

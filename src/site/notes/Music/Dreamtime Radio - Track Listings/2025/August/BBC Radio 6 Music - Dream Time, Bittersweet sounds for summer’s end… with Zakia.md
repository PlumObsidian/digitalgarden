DJ, broadcaster, writer and dreamer Zakia Sewell provides the soundtrack to your dreams - playing music to ease the mind, soothe the soul, and open portals to new dimensions…

This week Zakia leans into the bittersweet sounds as the summer slips away, with the usual dreamy adventure around the world in music. From her shelves, there’s dusty old favourites from Brazilian guitars, French-Tunisian disco and Catalan prog-rock, as well as from Lee Scratch Perry and Wayne Shorter. There’s also a big pile of new releases to share, including from keiyaA, cktrl, Makaya McCraven and Lau Ro.

Plus, we hear from the Russian singer and producer Kate NV, who shares some of her dreams alongside the track that made her fall back in love with music, chosen at random from her friend’s record shelves.

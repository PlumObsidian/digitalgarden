Using compression can also be a way of making signals in your mix sound fatter and fuller. Just like the previous example, you achieve this by reshaping the notes. This time, you alter the note by emphasizing its decay. To do this, you need to use a fast attack to attenuate the natural attack of an instrument’s notes. You also use a fast release. That way, the attenuation ceases quickly enough to allow the note’s decay to be unaffected.

You can then use make-up gain to turn the level of the signal back up to match the input level. So now, the decay of the instrument’s notes is much closer in level to the attack. This is a great way to fatten up kick drums, snare drums, and toms. You can also use this method to make guitars sound fatter and fuller by accentuating their sustain.

Of course, you must keep in mind that very fast attack and release times on a compressor can cause low-frequency distortion. So listen closely when using this technique.

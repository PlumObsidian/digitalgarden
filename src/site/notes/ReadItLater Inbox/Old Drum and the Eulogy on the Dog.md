# [Old Drum and the "Eulogy on the Dog"](https://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2009/11/old-drum-and-the-eulogy-on-the-dog.html)

[![Old Drum in 3D 1](https://blog.wfmu.org/.a/6a00d83451c29169e20120a6a053b6970c-320wi)](https://blog.wfmu.org/.a/6a00d83451c29169e20120a6a053b6970c-pi) Growing up mainly in the small Missouri town of [Warrensburg](http://goburg.com/), one couldn't help but become acquainted with the town's famous canine 'mascot'  [Old Drum](http://www.almostheaven-golden-retriever-rescue.org/old-drum.htm). Over the years I've heard many incarnations *of* and references *to* the eulogy written about him in 1870 by [George Graham Vest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Graham_Vest).[![George_Graham_Vest_-_Brady-Handy](https://blog.wfmu.org/.a/6a00d83451c29169e20120a6a06ab1970c-320wi)](https://blog.wfmu.org/.a/6a00d83451c29169e20120a6a06ab1970c-pi)  
The oft-recorded "Tribute to a Dog" text was originated by Mr. Vest after he took the case in Sedalia, Missouri, working for a farmer who was suing for the top dollar of the day- $150.00, because his prize foxhound had been shot by a neighbor, who had warned him, by the way, that he'd better keep his dawg at home.[![Old Dog Drum label](https://blog.wfmu.org/.a/6a00d83451c29169e20120a64ae36b970b-320wi)](https://blog.wfmu.org/.a/6a00d83451c29169e20120a64ae36b970b-pi)  
Vest's closing arguments in the case became known as his much-quoted "Eulogy on the Dog". Mr. Vest was a Missouri secessionist who served on the Confederate Senate at one time, and in 1853 had defended a young African American man accused of murder, later acquitted, the poor fellow was burned at the stake anyway by an angry mob. From 1882 on Vest was well-known for his spirited defense and political protection of Yellowstone Park.  
I recently came across yet another recording of the text (or at least the pertinent part of it that everyone seems to quote) as well as an a capella rendition of the Old Drum story on a seven-inch single, produced in Kansas City on the [Damon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damon_Records) label and performed by the ***Dockery Four*** (Bill Grace, Jerry Fuchs, John Chronister and Ed Grace). It went a bit higher than most singles that I buy, and I hoped that it would be in playable condition. I wasn't disappointed- it's actually rather nice. On the personal side, I was also interested because during my mother's singing career in the late 1940's and early 1950's, she had recorded a number of sides at Damon, and they were the only records that I had on that obscure label up to the present.  
Sadly, I couldn't track down much info about the Dockery Four themselves, although I haven't searched on their individual names. The label informs us that this version of *Old Dog Drum* was originally titled *Old* *Dog Tray*. Well, be it tray or drum, I'll always give a listen to any songs about dogs or food. I had expected that this would be some snappy little country song, but was pleasantly surprised with the actual style and content of the single.  
To flesh out this subject a bit, I have included another version of the "Triubute to a Dog" text, by my main man *Walter Brennan* (some people used to say that I could always steer any subject back to *Brennan* eventually), and a bonus tear-jerking dog song as well: *Old Shep*.  I learned recently from experience that it IS actually easier to write a tragic dog song, rather than a happy-go-lucky dog song. Oh yeah, these pieces are from Walter's brilliant *Dutchman's Gold* lp, really his best work, in my opinion.  I hope y'all enjoy these melodramatic servings of Dawg Music.[![Dutchman's cover](https://blog.wfmu.org/.a/6a00d83451c29169e20120a64ae6b8970b-120wi)](https://blog.wfmu.org/.a/6a00d83451c29169e20120a64ae6b8970b-pi)  [![Vest DogTribute sign in Kentucky](https://blog.wfmu.org/.a/6a00d83451c29169e20120a6a0c7af970c-320wi)](https://blog.wfmu.org/.a/6a00d83451c29169e20120a6a0c7af970c-pi)                 The MP3s:

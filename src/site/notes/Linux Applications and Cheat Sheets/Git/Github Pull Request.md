# GitHub Pull Request

A GitHub pull request is a feature that allows developers to propose changes to a repository. Here's a basic workflow for creating and managing a pull request:

1. **Create a New Branch**: Start by creating a new branch in your forked repository for the changes you want to propose.
    
2. **Make Changes**: Commit your changes to the new branch.
    
3. **Push Changes**: Push the changes to your fork on GitHub.
    
4. **Open a Pull Request**: On the GitHub page for your fork, click the "New pull request" button. Choose the source branch (your feature branch) and the destination branch (usually the main branch of the original repository).
    
5. **Review Changes**: Review the changes and ensure your pull request contains all the changes you want to suggest.
    
6. **Request a Review**: Request a review from the repository owner or other contributors. They will review your changes and provide feedback.
    
7. **Address Feedback**: If feedback is provided, address the comments by making additional changes and pushing them to your fork.
    
8. **Merge the Pull Request**: When everyone is satisfied with the changes, the repository owner can merge the pull request into the main branch.
    

Pull requests facilitate collaboration and discussion among contributors, ensuring that changes are reviewed and approved before being integrated into the main codebase.

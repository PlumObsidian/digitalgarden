To use a different theme for one page in Hugo, you can customize the theme for a specific page by modifying the front matter of that page. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Create a Theme for the Specific Page:**
    
    - You can create a custom theme for the page by copying the necessary files from an existing theme and placing them in a folder named after the page you want to customize. For example, if you want to customize the `about` page, you can create a folder named `about` in the `themes` directory and place the necessary files there.
2. **Specify the Theme in the Page Front Matter:**
    
    - In the front matter of the page, you can specify the theme you want to use for that particular page. For example, if you have a custom theme named `mytheme`, you can add `theme = "mytheme"` to the front matter of the page.

Here is an example of how you might configure this:

```
---
title: "About"
theme: "mytheme"
---
```

This will apply the `mytheme` theme specifically to the `about` page. Note that the theme specified in the front matter overrides the global theme setting defined in the `config.toml` file for that particular page.

3. **Ensure the Theme is Recognized:**
    - Make sure that the theme you are specifying is correctly installed and recognized by Hugo. You can do this by ensuring that the theme folder is in the `themes` directory and that it is correctly referenced in your Hugo configuration.

This approach allows you to apply different themes to different pages, providing greater flexibility in customizing your Hugo site.

I wanted a Roon endpoint on my little Pi Zero 2W but Ropiee won't pick up the WM8960 hat I have for it.

I had it running already as a Plexamp endpoint but wanted Roon for Tidal play.

The solution was to install Roonbridge with this script:


``` bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y wget https://download.roonlabs.net/builds/roonbridge-installer-linuxarmv8.sh chmod +x roonbridge-installer-linuxarmv8.sh sudo ./roonbridge-installer-linuxarmv8
```
To connect to the server I had to stop the Plexamp instance to free up the Alsa driver and set 'DSP for volume control but now works nicely..

Now in the garden hammock running this little thing on solar power üòâ

Diagnostics like so..

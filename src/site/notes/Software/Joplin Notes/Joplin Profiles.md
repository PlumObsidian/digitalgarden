# Joplin profiles

Joplin supports multiple profiles, allowing users to manage different sets of notes and settings independently. Here’s how you can set up and use profiles in Joplin:

- **Creating a New Profile**: To create a new profile, go to `File > Switch profile` and select `Create new profile`. Enter the profile name and press OK. The app will switch to this new profile, which you can then configure.
    
- **Switching Profiles**: To switch back to a previous profile, go to `File > Switch profile` and select the desired profile from the list. You can also switch back to the default profile by selecting `Default`.
    
- **Shared Settings**: Note that certain settings, such as language, font size, and theme, are shared across all profiles. However, settings like sync configuration are specific to each profile.
    
- **Syncing Profiles**: Each profile can be configured to sync with a different sync target, such as different cloud accounts or local folders. This is useful for separating work and personal notes.
    
- **Profile Management**: Joplin allows you to manage multiple profiles on both desktop and mobile devices. However, some users have reported issues with syncing multiple profiles on the Android client, where only one profile may sync properly.
    
- **Profile Switching on Command Line**: For advanced users, you can start Joplin with a specific profile using the `--profile` command-line option. This can be useful for running multiple instances of Joplin with different profiles on the same machine.
    

Profiles in Joplin help users organize their notes more effectively by allowing them to maintain separate environments for different purposes, such as work and personal use.

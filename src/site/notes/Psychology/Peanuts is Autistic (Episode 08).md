M: Our relationships are based on the three F's: Friends, family, and fictional characters.

*In [this episode](https://autisticculture.substack.com/p/episode-8-peanuts-is-autistic#details) of The Autistic Culture Podcast:*

Charles Schulz created an Autistic world with his treasured Peanuts characters. Schulz had Autistic traits like monotropic focus, delight in routine, and social differences. The Peanuts characters reflect his personality.

“When we are engaged in our special interests…We're in this transcendent state of meditation and we need that to heal. Our bodies heal, our minds heal. It helps make us who we are and how to survive this chaotic world that does not like us.” —Matt

The Peanuts characters are hyperlexic (common among Autistics), and use complex vocabulary. Charlie Brown represents the rejection sensitivity and social exclusion Autistics often face. He models resilience despite constant setbacks. Linus is a deep thinker and philosopher, yet keeps his comfort item (blanket) on hand and orally stims with a thumb in his mouth. Lucy’s perfectionism and sarcasm and Schroeder’s obsession with Beethoven further represent Autistic individuals.

Schulz introduced Franklin to the cast to promote racial equality, doubling down when he faced racist backlash. Autistics have justice sensitivity and tend to strongly value fairness.

The podcast hosts emphasize creating community for Autistics and embracing passions, as Schulz did, which, they argue, is essential for Autistic mental health. Schulz died as his final Peanuts strip ran.

Special interests deeply define Autistic identity. The co-hosts share their monotropic interests and relate to bonding with fictional characters.

“I think special interests can save our lives, but also create amazing things in the world…but not if they're a reward.” —Angela

Peanuts highlights social differences, idiosyncratic speech, and monotropic thinking which are common among Autistic people and shape Autistic Culture. Spend some time with us on a virtual culture trip, as we dance through the Autistic highs and lows of life with the Peanuts crew.

## Lack of interest and enjoyment

Anhedonia, as psychologists call it, is another very common symptom of depression. In this state you no longer get pleasure from things you once enjoyed, and struggle to make any kind of effort.

“Anhedonia probably translates best as loss of interest,” says Salkovskis. “It’s feeling listless, feeling totally flat, as if the world is colourless, everything is rubbish.”

This can extend to relationships, with the result that people with depression often become isolated. Adams says: “People who are depressed tend to find a sanctuary. They don’t want to be around people, they don’t go out as much, they spend more time at home.”

# [The Difference Between Being 'Uninterested" and "Disinterested"](https://www.thoughtco.com/disinterested-and-uninterested-1689552)

Updated on October 03, 2019

The adjective *disinterested* means impartial and without [bias](https://www.thoughtco.com/understanding-implicit-bias-4165634).

The adjective *uninterested* means indifferent or unconcerned.

## Examples

-   "I had a great desire to do a **disinterested** and pure thing--to express my belief in something higher."  
    (Saul Bellow, *Henderson the Rain King*, 1959)
-   "**Disinterested** intellectual curiosity is the life blood of real civilization." (G. M. Trevelyan)
-   "Americans are not isolationist; they're **uninterested**. So foreign policy is neglected, presidents find it hard to lead, and the noisy few trump the quiet many." (James M. Lindsay, *Foreign Affairs*, September/October 2000)

## Usage Notes

-   "You can be *disinterested* in something but not *uninterested*, and vice versa. For instance, because I'm not a betting man, I don't stand to gain or lose anything in the outcome of most sporting events; I might still enjoy watching a game: I'm *disinterested* but not *uninterested*. Conversely, I might not care about the intricacies of tax policies, but I certainly have a stake in the outcome: I'm *uninterested* but not *disinterested*."  
    (Jack Lynch, "Disinterested *versus* Uninterested," *The English Language: A User's Guide*. Focus Publishing, 2008)
-   "A large number of educated speakers and writers, for whatever reason, object to *disinterested* in the sense 'uninterested, unconcerned'--a sense it previously had but lost for awhile--and want the word to have only the meaning 'impartial, unprejudiced.' The criticized use has nevertheless gained such ground that it has practically driven out the other one. That change causes no harm to language as communication. We have merely lost a [synonym](https://www.thoughtco.com/synonym-definition-1692177) for *impartial* and gained one for *indifferent*."  
    (John Algeo, *The Origins and Development of the English Language*, 6th ed. Wadsworth, 2010)

You have 4 harm outcomes:

 1.  Call an Undertaker 
 2.  Call an Ambulance 
 3.  Call a Doctor 
 4.  Call in sick and have a day off work.

Moving the most "likely" of these outcomes is also weighted.

So for example, moving the likely outcome of "Call in sick" to  "most likely harm outcome" has less of an impact that increasing the likely outcome of "Call the undertaker".

Now Imagine this weighting as a piece of fruit:

If class 4 harm is a grape and class 1 is a watermelon.

If a lot of grapes were fired at your face in one go, they would still arguably hurt less than a headshot of several watermelons at once.

In maths language:

 **Ranking and prioritization**: In scenarios where ranking or prioritizing items based on their values is necessary, logarithmic weighting can be used to assign weights that reflect the relative importance of each item.

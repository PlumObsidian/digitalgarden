You have 4 harm outcomes:

4. Take a day off work
3. Call a Doctor
2. Call an Ambulance 
1. Call an Undertaker

Moving the most "likely" of these outcomes is also weighted.

So for example, moving the likely outcome of "having a day off work" to "highly likely" has less of an impact that increasing the likely outcome of "Call the undertaker".

Now Imagine this weighting as a piece of fruit:

If class 4 harm is a grape and class 1 is a watermelon.

If a lot of grapes were fired at your face in one go, they would still arguably hurt less than a headshot of several watermelons at once.

In maths language:

 **Ranking and prioritization**: In scenarios where ranking or prioritizing items based on their values is necessary, logarithmic weighting can be used to assign weights that reflect the relative importance of each item.

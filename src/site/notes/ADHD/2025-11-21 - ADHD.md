"To support an employee with ADHD, employers should focus on creating a tailored, inclusive work environment through reasonable adjustments. ADHD is recognized as a disability under the Equality Act 2010 in the UK and the Americans with Disabilities Act in the US, which legally obligates employers to make adjustments to prevent substantial disadvantage.
 **These adjustments must be practical, appropriate, and based on individual needs, as no two people with ADHD experience the condition the same way.**

Key adjustments include offering flexibility in working hours and location, such as allowing remote work or flexible start and finish times, which can help manage medication schedules and attention regulation.
 Providing a quiet workspace, noise-cancelling headphones, or white noise apps can reduce distractions, while allowing movement—such as standing desks or short breaks—can support focus.
 **Structuring the work environment with visual prompts like wall charts, checklists, and color-coded systems can aid organization and task management**.

Clear, written instructions and structured communication are essential. Using SMART goals, written agendas for meetings, and providing summaries in writing help mitigate executive functioning challenges.
 Breaking large projects into smaller, manageable tasks with interim deadlines—known as "chunking"—can improve task completion and reduce overwhelm.
 Offering extra time for tasks, responses, and processing can also be beneficial.

Supportive tools and technology, such as speech-to-text software, **reminder apps, digital calendars with alerts, and note-taking tools, can significantly assist with daily responsibilities.**
 Access to an ADHD coach or mentor can teach critical skills like time management, prioritization, and delegation, and is often a highly effective adjustment due to the 30% developmental delay in executive functioning typically associated with ADHD.
 Administrative support, such as task-swapping with colleagues or hiring a support worker through the Access to Work scheme, can be transformative for productivity.

**Managers should foster open communication by providing regular, clear feedback and scheduling routine check-ins to build confidence and reduce anxiety related to performance.**
 Training for managers and teams on neurodiversity can improve understanding and reduce stigma, creating a more supportive culture.
 It is recommended to frame accommodation requests around strengths and solutions rather than deficits—for example, suggesting a quiet workspace to enhance focus rather than mentioning ADHD directly.

Ultimately, the most effective approach is collaborative and ongoing: consult the employee about their specific challenges, implement adjustments, review their effectiveness, and refine them as needed.
 This process ensures that support is personalized and sustainable, enabling the employee to thrive in their role."

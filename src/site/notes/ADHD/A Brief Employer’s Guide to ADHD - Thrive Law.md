This is a neurodivergent condition with behavioural symptoms such as impulsiveness and hyperactivity.

ADHD can be a disability under the Equality Act 2010, if the condition has a substantial and long-term negative effect on an individual’s ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.

-   Talk to the employee and see how they are feeling.
-   Understand with the employee how their job affects their ADHD and how their ADHD affects their job.
-   Discuss what reasonable adjustments you can offer and agree with the employee which reasonable adjustments will benefit them.
-   Create a development plan with the employee to help them succeed.
-   Consider the formatting which may be required for different types of documents. Communicate across the team on these adjustments.
-   Ensure you support the employee as and when they require.
-   Regularly review the employees’ working arrangements and adjust if you both deem it necessary.
-   Provide training on general awareness on neurodiversity with a focus on ADHD to help the team’s knowledge and understanding.
-   Create Licences to Thrive to understand how the employees work best.

Allow extra time to prepare for meetings
